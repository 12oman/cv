        <p>As an empathic leader, I foster collaborative, high-performing teams and cultivate vibrant communities of
            practice while building relationships with industry. With experience designing and delivering
            curricula from levels 5 to 9,
            I am committed to enriching education at the nexus of creativity, technology, and the interconnected realms
            of te ao Māori and contemporary art, empowering the next generation of digital innovators and creative
            leaders.
