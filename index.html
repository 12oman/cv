        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
            I am an artist, educator, and developer at the forefront of Aotearoa's creative and technology sectors. With
            a
            decade of teaching excellence, I engage diverse learners in transformative education that celebrates the
            interconnectedness of te ao Māori, art and emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an empathic leader, I foster collaborative, high-performing teams and cultivate vibrant communities of
            practice while fostering relationships with industry stakeholders. With experience designing and delivering
            curricula from levels 5 to 9,
            I am committed to enriching education at the nexus of creativity, technology, and the interconnected realms
            of te ao Māori and contemporary art, empowering the next generation of digital innovators and creative
            leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
            I deeply understand the necessity for sustainable creative pathways. My students enjoy meaningful work at
            companies like RocketLab, Xero, PwC, Nexbe and more.
